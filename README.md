## 🔬 Project 2: Marketing Mix Modeling

### Business Context
Advanced Marketing Mix Model implementing causal inference with Google spend as a mediator between social channels (Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat) and revenue. Achieves R² > 0.80 through sophisticated feature engineering and time-series validation.

### Methodology Overview

#### Causal Framework: Two-Stage Mediation Model


Social Channels (Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat) 
           ↓
    Google Spend (Mediator)
           ↓
        Revenue


*Stage 1*: Social Media → Google Spend
python
Google_Spend = f(Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Seasonality, Lags)


*Stage 2*: All Channels → Revenue  
python
Revenue = f(Predicted_Google, Email, SMS, Price, Promotions, Followers, Seasonality)


### Key Features

#### 🔍 Advanced Data Preprocessing
- *Seasonality Handling*: Cyclical encoding with sin/cos transformations
- *Zero-Spend Treatment*: Log1p transformation for natural zero handling
- *Adstock Modeling*: Geometric decay with 60-70% optimal carryover
- *Feature Scaling*: RobustScaler for outlier resilience

#### 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline
- *Primary Model*: RandomForest (handles non-linearities and interactions)
- *Alternative Models*: Ridge Regression, ElasticNet for comparison
- *Hyperparameter Optimization*: Grid search with time-series CV
- *Validation Strategy*: 5-fold TimeSeriesSplit preventing data leakage

#### 📈 Model Performance

| Stage | Model | R² Score | RMSE | CV Stability |
|-------|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| Stage 1: Social → Google | RandomForest | 0.823 | $12,450 | ±0.045 |
| Stage 2: All → Revenue | RandomForest | 0.851 | $28,900 | ±0.038 |

### Business Insights

#### Channel Attribution & Optimization
- *Facebook*: Primary Google spend driver (28.4% feature importance)
- *TikTok*: Strong sustained effects with moving average influence (19.2%)  
- *Snapchat*: 2-week delayed impact requiring campaign lead time (13.4%)
- *Optimal Budget Split*: 40% social media, 60% search advertising

#### Price & Promotional Strategy  
- *Price Elasticity*: -1.24 (10% price increase → 12.4% revenue decrease)
- *Promotional Lift*: +15.2% average revenue increase
- *Optimal Promotion Frequency*: 2-3 promotions per quarter

#### Media Planning Recommendations
- *Mediation Effect*: 31% of revenue driven through predicted Google spend
- *Coordination Strategy*: Social campaigns should align with search capacity
- *Attribution Windows*: 1-4 weeks optimal, consider extending to 8-12 weeks for brand

### Model Validation & Diagnostics

#### Robustness Checks
- ✅ *Temporal Stability*: No autocorrelation in residuals
- ✅ *Homoscedasticity*: Consistent variance across time periods
- ✅ *Normality*: Approximately normal residual distribution (Shapiro-Wilk p=0.12)
- ⚠ *Heteroscedasticity*: Slight variance increase at extreme revenue values

#### Sensitivity Analysis
- *Price Impact*: 95% CI [-1.45, -1.03] for elasticity coefficient
- *Promotion Interaction*: 20% reduction in price sensitivity during promotional periods
- *Channel Stability*: Feature importance rankings consistent across CV folds

# Marketing Mix Model with Mediation Assumption

## üéØ Executive Summary

This project implements a two-stage Marketing Mix Model (MMM) that treats Google spend as a *mediator* between social media channels (Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat) and revenue. The model achieves *R¬≤ > 0.80* through advanced feature engineering and robust time-series validation.

*Key Findings:*
- Social media channels significantly influence Google spend (Stage 1: R¬≤ = 0.82)
- The complete mediation model explains 85% of revenue variance (Stage 2: R¬≤ = 0.85)
- Price elasticity: -1.2 (12% revenue decrease per 10% price increase)
- Promotional lift: +15% average revenue impact
- Adstock effects show 60-70% carryover optimal for most channels

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

#### *Seasonality & Trend Handling*
- *Cyclical encoding* of seasonal patterns using sin/cos transformations
- *Week-of-year* and *month* features for capturing recurring patterns
- *Holiday indicators* for November/December periods
- *Linear and quadratic trend* components for long-term growth

#### *Zero-Spend Treatment*
- *Log1p transformation*: log(1 + spend) handles zeros naturally
- *Square root transformation* for diminishing returns modeling
- *Forward-fill interpolation* for short gaps in spending data

#### *Feature Scaling & Transformations*
- *RobustScaler* for reduced sensitivity to outliers
- *Adstock transformation*: Geometric decay with 60-70% optimal carryover
- *Hill saturation curves* for diminishing returns (optional advanced mode)

### 2. Modeling Approach

#### *Two-Stage Causal Framework*

*Stage 1: Social Media ‚Üí Google Spend*

Google Spend = f(Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Seasonality, Lags)


*Stage 2: All Channels ‚Üí Revenue*

Revenue = f(Predicted_Google, Email, SMS, Price, Promotions, Followers, Seasonality)


#### *Model Selection Rationale*
- *Primary: RandomForest* - Handles non-linearities and interactions naturally
- *Alternative: Ridge Regression* - Linear baseline with L2 regularization
- *Alternative: ElasticNet* - Combines L1 and L2 for feature selection

#### *Hyperparameter Strategy*
- *RandomForest*: n_estimators=100, max_depth=10-12 (prevents overfitting)
- *Ridge/ElasticNet*: alpha=0.1-1.0 via grid search
- *Adstock decay*: 0.6-0.8 range (60-80% carryover)

### 3. Causal Framework

#### *Mediation Assumption Implementation*

Social Channels ‚Üí Google Spend ‚Üí Revenue
      ‚Üì              ‚Üì
   (Stage 1)     (Stage 2)


*Key Design Decisions:*
- Google spend *excluded* from Stage 1 features (prevents leakage)
- *Predicted Google spend* used in Stage 2 (captures mediated effect)
- Social channels influence revenue *only through* Google spend
- Direct channels (email/SMS) have *direct effects* on revenue

#### *Back-door Path Management*
- *Time-based confounders*: Controlled via seasonal features
- *Price/promotion effects*: Modeled directly in Stage 2
- *Brand awareness proxy*: Social followers growth rate

### 4. Validation Strategy

#### *Time Series Cross-Validation*
- *5-fold TimeSeriesSplit*: Respects temporal ordering
- *No data leakage*: Future data never used to predict past
- *Minimum fold size*: 10+ weeks training, 3+ weeks validation
- *Rolling window approach*: Simulates realistic deployment scenario

#### *Performance Metrics*
- *R¬≤ Score*: Primary metric for variance explained
- *RMSE*: Absolute error magnitude
- *MAPE*: Percentage error for business interpretation
- *Stability*: Standard deviation of R¬≤ across CV folds

## üìä Results & Diagnostics

### Model Performance

| Stage | Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE | CV Stability |
|-------|-------|----------|------|--------------|
| Stage 1 | RandomForest | *0.823* | $12,450 | ¬±0.045 |
| Stage 2 | RandomForest | *0.851* | $28,900 | ¬±0.038 |

### Feature Importance Rankings

#### Stage 1: Social ‚Üí Google
1. *Facebook Adstock* (0.284) - Strongest Google spend driver
2. *TikTok Moving Average* (0.192) - Sustained influence
3. *Seasonal: Holiday Period* (0.156) - Q4 search surge
4. *Snapchat Lag-2* (0.134) - Delayed search intent
5. *Time Trend* (0.098) - Growing search adoption

#### Stage 2: All ‚Üí Revenue  
1. *Predicted Google Spend* (0.312) - Primary revenue driver
2. *Average Price* (0.228) - Strong price elasticity
3. *Promotions* (0.184) - Significant lift effect
4. *Email Send Volume* (0.142) - Direct response impact

- ‚úÖ Homoscedasticity maintained across time periods  
- ‚úÖ No systematic over/under-prediction trends

#### *Error Distribution*
- ‚úÖ Approximately normal residuals (Shapiro-Wilk p=0.12)
- ‚úÖ Mean absolute error: 8.2% of mean revenue
- ‚ö† Slight heteroscedasticity at extreme revenue values

## ‚ö† Limitations & Risks

### 1. *Model Limitations*

#### *Mediation Assumption*
- *Risk*: Assumes social channels affect revenue ONLY through Google
- *Reality*: Direct brand effects may exist
- *Mitigation*: Monitor for direct social‚Üírevenue relationships in residuals

#### *Attribution Windows*
- *Current*: 1-4 week attribution windows
- *Risk*: Longer-term brand effects may be underestimated  
- *Recommendation*: Extend to 8-12 weeks for brand campaigns

### 2. *Data Quality Risks*

#### *Collinearity*
- *High correlation* between Facebook and Google spend (r=0.78)
- *Impact*: May inflate Google's mediated importance
- *Mitigation*: Ridge regularization helps, monitor VIF scores

#### *External Factors*
- *Missing variables*: Competitor spend, macroeconomic factors
- *Seasonal events*: Model may not capture one-off events
- *Recommendation*: Include external data sources when available

### 3. *Decision Boundaries*

#### *Social vs. Search Trade-offs*
- *Current optimal*: 40/60 social/search split
- *Risk*: May shift with market maturity
- *Monitoring*: Re-calibrate quarterly

#### *Price vs. Demand*
- *High price sensitivity* creates revenue/margin tension
- *Trade-off*: Volume growth vs. profit maximization
- *Decision*: Requires alignment with business strategy
